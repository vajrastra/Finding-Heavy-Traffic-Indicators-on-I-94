# Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94

Explore the factors contributing to heavy traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway using data analysis. This project investigates how time and weather impact traffic volume, offering insights for urban planning and transportation management.

## Dataset

The project uses the I-94 traffic dataset, covering 2012-2018, sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume). The dataset contains hourly traffic and weather data for the westbound lane.

## Analysis

- **Time Indicators:** Investigate traffic patterns based on time of day, week, and month.
- **Weather Indicators:** Explore the correlation between weather conditions and traffic volume.

## Key Insights

- Traffic is heavier during warm months (Mar-Oct) and on workdays.
- Rush hours around 7 AM and 4 PM show elevated traffic.
- Surprisingly, adverse weather like snow and light rain leads to higher traffic.
- Considerable drop in traffic during July 2016 due to road construction.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vajrastra/Finding-Heavy-Traffic-Indicators-on-I-94.git`
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib`
3. Explore Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
